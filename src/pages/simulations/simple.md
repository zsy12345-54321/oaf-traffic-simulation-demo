title: Simple Traffic Simulation
description: Building Traffic Simulation From Scratch
---

This simulation demonstrate a basic application and essential functions of SUMO for traffic analysis using a simple network.

## SUMO Configuration File

You can find SUMO configuration file [here](https://github.com/zsy12345-54321/oaf-traffic-simulation-demo/tree/main/sumo/simple)

### Simulation Overview

In this simulation, the traffic state will be analyzed with the application of SUMO. The example network includes four origins, four destinations as well as two unsignalized intersections. In the investigated area, each road for outbound traffic has three lanes and the allowed traffic movements on each lane are restricted. U-turn behaviors are prohibited at all intersections. Moreover, a higher priority has been given to the eastbound and westbound traffic.
